# I-Love-Trees
Small project to create randomized nature elements...

At first, I just wanted to create a random fractal tree and this was funny, so I decided to add new random elements to the drawing canvas... I think that the next element will be a sheep and/or a flower... I really don't know... Remember, I do this for fun and during my freetime just to relax ;-)

Have fun !
